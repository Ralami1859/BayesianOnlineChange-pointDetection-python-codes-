 --- the python codes of the algorithms BOCD and BOCDm
 

============================ Python codes =======================================

 -1- BOCD_Algorithms.py contains the four versions of the Bayesian Online Change-point Detection
 -2- demoOnlineDetection.py is a demonstration of the four algorithms (BOCD, BOCDm, BOCD_restart, BOCDm_restart)
	in a piece-wise Bernoulli environment
	
----> For a demo please launch the following script: demoOnlineDetection.py
